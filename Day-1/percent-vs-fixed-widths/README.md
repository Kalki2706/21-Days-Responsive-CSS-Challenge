# Percent VS Fixed Widths

## _"Pages are always responsive, they lose responsiveness when we give values to them."_ - **_Kevin Powell_**

<!-- When we give width in pixels it looses its responsiveness.-->

### We can give percentage instead of px to make it responsive as it is.

![parent & child div](./percent-vs-fixed-width.png)

`width: 80%;` _Width of parent div_
<br>
`width: 80%;` _Width of child div_

### **The child will get width of its parent div not width of the full page.**
